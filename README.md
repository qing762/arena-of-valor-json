# Honor of Kings 王者荣耀 API 

An API that scrapes data from [Honor of Kings official website](https://pvp.qq.com/web201605/herolist.shtml) and convert into JSON format.

## How it works

It scrapes data from [Honor of Kings official website](https://pvp.qq.com/web201605/herolist.shtml) and format/beautify it into a JSON format.
